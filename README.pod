=head1 NAME

Game::Tibia::Packet - Session layer support for the MMORPG Tibia

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Game::Tibia::Packet;

    # decrypt Tibia packet
    my $read; my $ret = $sock->recv($read, 1024);
    my $res = Game::Tibia::Packet->new(packet => $read, xtea => $xtea_key);
    $packet_type = unpack('C', $res->payload);


    # encrypt a Tibia speech packet
    my $p = Game::Tibia::Packet->new;
    $p->payload .= pack("C S S S/A S C SSC S/A",
        0xAA, 0x1, 0x0, "Perl", 0, 1, 1, 1, 8,
        "Game::Tibia::Packet says Hi!\n:-)");
    $sock->send($p->finalize($xtea_key}))

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Methods for constructing Tibia Gameserver (XTEA) packets. Handles checksum calculation and symmetric encryption depending on the requested Tibia version.

Should work with all Tibia versions less than 9.80.

=head1 METHODS AND ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item new(version => $version, [packet => $payload, xtea => $xtea])

Constructs a new Game::Tibia::Packet instance of version C<$version>. If payload and XTEA are given, the payload will be decrypted and trimmed to correct size.

=item isValid($packet)

Checks if packet's adler32 digest matches (A totally unnecessary thing on Cipsoft's part, as we already have TCP checksum. Why hash again?)

=item payload() : lvalue

returns the payload as lvalue (so you can concat on it)

=item finalize([$XTEA_KEY])

Finalizes the packet. XTEA encrypts, prepends checksum and length.

=item version($version)

Returns a hash reference with protocol traits. For example for 840, it returns:

    { gmbyte => 1, outfit_addons => 1, adler32 => 1, acc_name => 1,
      stamina => 1, xtea => 1, VERSION => 840, rsa => 1, lvl_on_msg => 1 };
