=head1 NAME

Game::Tibia::Packet - Session layer support for the MMORPG Tibia

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Game::Tibia::Packet;

    # decrypt Tibia packet
    my $read; my $ret = $sock->recv($read, 1024);
    my $res = Game::Tibia::Packet->new($read, $xtea_key);
    $packet_type = unpack('C', $res->payload);


    # encrypt a Tibia speech packet
    my $p = Game::Tibia::Packet->new;
    $p->payload .= pack("C S S S/A S C SSC S/A",
        0xAA, 0x1, 0x0, "Perl", 0, 1, 1, 1, 8,
        "Game::Tibia::Packet says Hi!\n:-)");
    $sock->send($p->finalize($xtea_key}))

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Methods for constructing Tibia packets. Doesn't handle the XTEA key exchange yet, only what comes after it. i.e. It doesn't do that much besides calculating Adler32 digest and XTEA encryption.

Tested working with Tibia 8.6, but will probably work with later protocol versions too.

=head1 METHODS AND ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item new([$payload, $xtea])

Constructs a new Game::Tibia::Packet instance. If payload and XTEA are given, the payload will be decrypted and trimmed to correct size. 

=item isValid($packet)

Checks if packet's adler32 digest matches (A totally unnecessary thing on Cipsoft's part, as we already have TCP checksum. Why hash again?) 

=item payload() : lvalue

returns the payload as lvalue (so you can concat on it)

=item finalize([$XTEA_KEY])

Finalizes the packet. XTEA encrypts, prepends checksum and length.
