=head1 NAME

Game::Tibia::Packet - Session layer support for the MMORPG Tibia

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Game::Tibia::Packet;

    # decrypt Tibia packet
    my $read; my $ret = $sock->recv($read, 1024);
    my $res = Game::Tibia::Packet->new(packet => $read, xtea => $xtea_key);
    $packet_type = unpack('C', $res->payload);


    # encrypt a Tibia speech packet
    my $p = Game::Tibia::Packet->new;
    $p->payload .= pack("C S S S/A S C SSC S/A",
        0xAA, 0x1, 0x0, "Perl", 0, 1, 1, 1, 8,
        "Game::Tibia::Packet says Hi!\n:-)");
    $sock->send($p->finalize($xtea_key}))

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Methods for constructing Tibia Gameserver (XTEA) packets. Handles checksum calculation and symmetric encryption depending on the requested Tibia version.

Tested working with Tibia 8.1, but will probably work with other protocol versions too.

=head1 METHODS AND ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item new([packet => $payload, xtea => $xtea, version => 860])

Constructs a new Game::Tibia::Packet instance. If payload and XTEA are given, the payload will be decrypted and trimmed to correct size. version argument defaults to 860.

=item isValid($packet)

Checks if packet's adler32 digest matches (A totally unnecessary thing on Cipsoft's part, as we already have TCP checksum. Why hash again?) 

=item payload() : lvalue

returns the payload as lvalue (so you can concat on it)

=item finalize([$XTEA_KEY])

Finalizes the packet. XTEA encrypts, prepends checksum and length.

=item version($version)

Returns a hash reference with size information about a protocol version.
For example, for 860 it returns:

    {XTEA => 16, RSA => 128, ADLER32 => 4, ACCNUM => 0, GET_CHARLIST => 147, LOGIN_CHAR => 135}

Sizes are in bytes.
